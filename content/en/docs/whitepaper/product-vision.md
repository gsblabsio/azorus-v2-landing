## Blockchain Science

We believe there is no "correct" data science computing language to retrieve, analyze, and visualize blockchain data. Our goal is to leave that decision up to the user to determine what the right tool is for the job. Thus, Azorus will first launch with in-browser kernels that have SQL, Python, and R capabilties along with popular machine learning and artificial intelligence modules. As the platform grows we will expand our coverage depending on customer demand.

## Enterprise Capabilities

If Azorus intends to handle datastreams that power web3 businesses or become the platform for data scientists to build large scale economic models, we need to easily handle large computational loads. Data stability and reliability will always be a first class citizen to inspire confidence in the platform from not just instituational customers, but also newcomers to the blockchain analytics industry who just want to learn how everything works.

## Feedback Loop

Other blockchains like Ethereum already have a saturated market of analytics tooling vying for attention. By developing Azorus on nascent UTXO technology, we have the advantage of cultivating product feedback very early to address customer issues, opportunity to set the analytics standard, and to move much faster than being in a crowded market. In addition to this, it allows us to invite and foster a collaborative spirit for the next generation of blockchain analysts into the ecosystem. 

## Hybrid Service

The end goal is to have a fully decentralized data infrastructure for all audiences of the platform inclding data providers, computation miners, blockchain analysts, and consumers. We imagine everyone having access to Azorus functionality straight from their Ergo/UTXO node without the need to connect to the Azorus website and preserve their individual privacy. To achieve this though, it is crucial to recognize that a bridge is required to migrate potential customers from the current web2 paradigm and future web3 world. This hybrid approach ensures Azorus offers an experience that web2 users are already familiar with but also move the company toward profitability instead of spinning our wheels waiting for "mass adoption" to happen.

## Platform Ownership

The blockchain analytics business relies on the web2 paradigm of having its creators and customer base share their content with others. This relationship dynamic benefits the service provider only as it offers them subscription revenue, branding, and valuable social signals to further improve their product. All of this is obtained without ever reciprocating anything in return for this skewed interaction. The Azorus team maintains that all design philosophy will adhere to the ideal that everyone should be compensated in some way, shape or form for their contributions.
