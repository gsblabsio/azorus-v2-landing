We have listed a few notable callouts below regarding the design of the Azorus token.

* Azorus will launch on the Ergo blockchain and emit a fixed-supply of 300M tokens over the course of 30 years. 
* The core Azorus team will have a 1 year vesting schedule with a 12 months cliff.
* Early investors, on the other hand, will have all their tokens vested daily within the first year depending on their contribution tier.

## [WIP] Utility

Although not fully baked out yet we plan to have staking functionality in the future. For example, someone can generate additional Azorus tokens by staking them on an analyst to boost their visibility on the platform. This in turn rewards everyone in the "analyst stake pool" with higher platform rewards per unit of data. 

## [WIP] Incentivization 

Every participant of the Azorus blockchain intelligence platform will serve their own purposes and incentives for purchasing the token.

| Audience | Purpose | Incentives |

| Blockchain Analyst | Develop reports, charts, machine learning models, and APIs from onchain & offchain data | Earn platform rewards, tips, gated content reports | 
| General Consumer | Find answers to their questions and share data insights with others | Stake tokens on specific analyst or report |
